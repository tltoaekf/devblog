## Alzheimer's desease

-------

 - What is Alzheimer's desease?
    - Alzheimer's desease is the brain desease that slowly destroys memory, thinking skills and ability to complete the simple tasks. `NIH. What Is Alzheimer's Disease?`

 - Alzheimer's desease usually showed by an age of 60 or older people. About 674 thousand people in Korea and about 6.2 million Americans had Alzheimer in 2021.

## Cognitive and Brain Reserve

-------

 - Cognitive reserve refers to individual differences in how tasks are performed that may allow some people to be more resilient than others. The concept of cognitive reserve holds out the promise of interventions that could slow cognitive aging or reduce the risk of dementia.
 
 - In contrast, the concept of CR suggests that the brain actively attempts to cope with brain damage by using pre-existing cognitive processing approaches or by enlisting compensatory approaches. `Stern Y. What is cognitive reserve? Theory and research application of the reserve concept. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society. 2002; 8:448–460. [PubMed: 11939702]` `Stern Y. Cognitive reserve. Neuropsychologia. 2009; 47:2015–2028. [PubMed: 19467352]` This would allow an individual with high CR to better cope with the brain damage than an individual with lower CR. In CR, brain function rather than brain size is the relevant variable. Thus the CR concept is an active form of reserve in that, the same amount of brain damage or pathology will have different effects on different people, even when brain size is held constant.

 - Those who engaged in more leisure activities had 38% less risk of developing dementia. The authors summarized all of the studies to calculate the protective effect of higher CR and found that it decreased the risk of developing dementia by 46%.

 - In contrast, once AD emerges, those with higher reserve show more rapid decline. In one of the earliest studies of this type, we matched patients with AD for clinical severity and then followed them over time. `Stern Y, Tang MX, Denaro J, Mayeux R. Increased risk of mortality in Alzheimer's disease patients with more advanced educational and occupational attainment. Annals of Neurology. 1995;37:590–595. [PubMed: 7755353]` Those with greater education or occupational attainment died sooner than those with less attainment.

 - Individuals with higher CR can tolerate more pathology so the point at which cognitive functions begin to be affected will be later than in those with lower CR. However, we reasoned that there is common point in all people where the pathology is so severe that function cannot be maintained. Given these assumptions, individuals with higher CR will begin their cognitive decline when pathology is more advanced and thus have less time until they reach the point where pathology overwhelms function. This results in a more rapid rate of decline once it begins.
