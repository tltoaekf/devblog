## Introduction
​
We are gonna learn about the `Swift` way of handling variables and functions.
​
---
​
## Storing number to a variable
​
```swift
let a = 3 // 1. this is to store number 3 to a variable named a
let b = 4 // 2. store 5 to b
let sum = a + b // 3. if we add the two the sum will be 7
```
​
Storing numbers inside a variable is quite easy in swift. All you have to do is assign a number to a variable using `=` sign.
​
## Basic Function
​
```swift
func addThreeAndFour() { // 1. name a function
    let a = 3 // 2. variable 1
    let b = 4 // 3. variable 2
​
    let sum = a + b // 4. adding
    print(sum) // 5. printing
}
```
​
Function can be created with `func` keyword. Much like an english sentence, swift is known for highly readable code. Inside the function, I added variables we've discussed previously. With functions, we can recycle our codes easily.
​
Here is another example of a function:
​
```swift
func add(a: Int, b: Int) { // 1. with inputs
    let sum = a + b
    print(sum)
}
```
​
This functions can take two inputs: `a: Int` and `b: Int`. `:Int` means the input `a` can only take an integer. So if we put a non-integer value, the function won't work.
​
Here is another example of a function:
​
```swift
func add2(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int { // 1. with return
    let sum = a + b
    return sum
}
```
​
This time the function has another feature: `-> Int`. This means the function will return a value when it's called. Previous functions don't return any value. They just print the output using `print`. This time the function returns the calculated `sum`.

## Conclusion
​
We've covered:
​
1. setting a number to a variable.
1. A function that takes 0 input and returns nothing.
1. A function that takes inputs and returns nothing.
1. A function that takes inputs and returns something.
