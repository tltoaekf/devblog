## Introduction

---

 - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO. Ageing and Health (WHO, 2018).`
 - dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key strategy to mitigate the identifed risk factors. `Livingston, G. et al. Dementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission. Te Lancet 396, 413–446(2020).`

## Result

---

Statistically signifcant differences were observed for the diferent CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the diferent age groups for Memory Sweep (p=0.013), Babble Bots (p<0.001) and Unique (p<0.001).

### CMG Score

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants

## Discussion

 - Tough the changes in diferent cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented22,23, there is less evidence on the plasticity of these diferent cognitive functions across the lifespan23–25. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of diferent ages
